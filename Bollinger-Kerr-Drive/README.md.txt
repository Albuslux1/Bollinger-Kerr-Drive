Major Unknowns/Risks:

    Non-linear backreaction - will the scalar field collapse or form singularities?

    Inner horizon instability - Cauchy horizon is known to be unstable to perturbations

    Quantum effects - at the Planck scale near r=0, GR breaks down

    Engineering feasibility - creating/maintaining micro Kerr holes is beyond current tech

If This Fails, Here's What We Learn:

Even if the drive doesn't work, we'll discover:

    New stability criteria for Kerr perturbations

    Fundamental limits of energy extraction

    Novel resonance effects in curved spacetime

    Potential experimental signatures for black hole observations

The Path Forward:

We treat this as a scientific exploration not a foregone conclusion. Each step:

    Derive mathematically

    Identify assumptions

    Stress-test against known physics

    Document both successes and failures
